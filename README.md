# File Interleaver Tool

<br>

## 📖 Description

**File Interleaver Tool** is a lightweight utility for creating ordered file sequences with interval-based insertion.

The project was originally developed to solve a practical problem - preparing a playlist for a New Year's Eve party.  
It allows inserting a specific file (or a randomly selected file from a folder) at fixed intervals within a shuffled sequence of files.

Although inspired by a music use-case, the tool works with **any type of file**, making it a flexible solution.

## ✨ Features

- Shuffle files from a selected folder
- Insert a special file at fixed intervals
- Supports single file or folder of special files (**special files** = files inserted as interludes)
- Works with any file type
- Automatically numbers output files
- Creates a dedicated output folder (`RESULT`)
- Simple PowerShell GUI

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

The project is intentionally simple and divided into two layers:

- **GUI layer (PowerShell)**  
  Handles **user interaction**, including:
  - selecting the main folder
  - optionally selecting a folder for special files (used as interludes)
  - setting the interval for insertion
  - controlling the process (Start / Stop)

- **Logic layer (Python)**  
  Responsible for:
  - file shuffling
  - interval insertion logic
  - copying and renaming files into a clean output folder

<br>

This separation keeps the core logic clean, reusable, and easy to extend.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Select a folder with main input files  
2. Decide how to insert special files:
   - Choose a single file, or  
   - Enable the option to select a folder with multiple files  
3. Set the interval (e.g., every 6 files)  
4. Start the process  

<br>

The program will:
- shuffle all files from the main folder
- insert a special file (or randomly selected file from the special folder) at every n-th position
- copy and rename files into a new `RESULT` folder

<br>

### Notes

- Original files are **never modified**
- All output files are copied into:

```
<selected_folder>/RESULT
```

- Input files are always shuffled (no option to disable)

## 📌 Example

Folder structure:

```
main/
├── song1.mp3
├── song2.mp3
├── song3.mp3
├── song4.mp3
├── song5.mp3
└── song6.mp3
```

<br>

### Example 1 - Single special file

Settings:

```
Main folder: main/
Interval: 3
Special file: jingle.mp3
```

Output:

```
main/
├── song1.mp3
├── song2.mp3
├── song3.mp3
├── song4.mp3
├── song5.mp3
└── song6.mp3
│
└── RESULT/
    ├── 1. song2.mp3
    ├── 2. song4.mp3
    ├── 3. [INTERLUDE] jingle.mp3
    ├── 4. song3.mp3
    ├── 5. song1.mp3
    ├── 6. [INTERLUDE] jingle.mp3
    ├── 7. song5.mp3
    └── 8. song6.mp3
```

<br>

### Example 2 - Folder of special files

Folder structure for special files:

```
special/
├── jingle1.mp3
├── jingle2.mp3
└── jingle3.mp3
```

Settings:

```
Main folder: main/
Interval: 3
Special folder: special/
```

Output (special files randomly picked from `special/` folder):

```
main/
├── song1.mp3
├── song2.mp3
├── song3.mp3
├── song4.mp3
├── song5.mp3
└── song6.mp3
│
└── RESULT/
    ├── 1. song2.mp3
    ├── 2. song4.mp3
    ├── 3. [INTERLUDE] jingle2.mp3
    ├── 4. song3.mp3
    ├── 5. song1.mp3
    ├── 6. [INTERLUDE] jingle1.mp3
    ├── 7. song5.mp3
    └── 8. song6.mp3
```
